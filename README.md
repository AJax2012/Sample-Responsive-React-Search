# Sample React Search

This project uses mostly vanilla React with TypeScript The only libraries included are Tailwind CSS, classnames, and idb (beyond react, vite, and postcss related libraries). It is a sample react search input with the following features:

- search cache
- debounce
- accessibility
- fake API

In essence, this is a basic, vanilla search input that you might find in a modern web application. I would normally recommend using libraries for creating an input, but this might be a good referece for interviews. I originally got the idea from watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju6VSLKXrJg).

## About Vite with React for Code Sandbox
This is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) project together with React.

[![Edit in CodeSandbox](https://assets.codesandbox.io/github/button-edit-lime.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/codesandbox/codesandbox-template-vite-react/main)

[Configuration](https://codesandbox.io/docs/projects/learn/setting-up/tasks) has been added to optimize it for [CodeSandbox Projects](https://codesandbox.io/p/dashboard).
